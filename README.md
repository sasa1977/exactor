ExActor
=======
Macros for easier implementation and usage of gen_server based actors (processes) in Elixir.
This library is inspired by (though not depending on) [GenX](https://github.com/yrashk/genx), but in addition, removes some more boilerplate and changes some semantics of the handle_call/cast responses.

# Examples

## Basic usage

```elixir
defmodule Actor do
  use ExActor
  
  defcast inc(x), state: state, do: new_state(state + x)
  defcall get, state: state, do: state
end

{:ok, act} = Actor.start(1)
Actor.get(act)         # 1

Actor.inc(act, 2)
Actor.get(act)         # 3
```

## Singleton actors

```elixir
defmodule SingletonActor do
  use ExActor, export: :singleton   # The actor process will be locally registered

  defcall get, state: state, do: state
  defcast set(x), do: new_state(x)
end

SingletonActor.start
SingletonActor.set(5)
SingletonActor.get
```

## Handling of return values

```elixir
defcall a, state: state, do: 5                # responds 5, doesn't change state
defcall b, do: reply(5, 6)                    # responds 5, sets new state to 6
defcall c, do: {:reply, response, newstate}   # standard gen_server response is left intact

defcast c, do: :ok                            # ignores response, doesn't change state
defcast d, do: new_state(:ok)                 # sets new state
defcast f, do: {:noreply, newstate}           # standard gen_server response is left intact

def init(arg), do: initial_state(arg)         # sets initial state
def init(arg), do: {:ok, arg}                 # standard gen_server response    
```
    
## Simplified starting
    
```elixir
Actor.start         # same as Actor.start(nil)
Actor.start(args)
Actor.start(args, options)

Actor.start_link
Actor.start_link(args)
Actor.startLink(args, options)
```
    
## Tuple modules support
    
```elixir
actor = Actor.actor_start_link(0)

# alternatively, from pid:
actor = Actor.actor(pid)

# operations can be called directly on actor which is a tuple module
actor.inc(1)

# cast returns the actor on which it operates, so you can chain calls
actor.
  inc(5).
  inc(10).
  get
 ```
